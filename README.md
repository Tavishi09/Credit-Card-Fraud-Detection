# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Implemented ML models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Built a model to classify fraud transactions dealing with high class imbalanced data set containing transactions data.
Performed various techniques like Random Unde sampling, Near Miss algorithm and SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
Compared different models based on their F1 score and Confusion Matrix and plotted their ROC and learning curves.
